\subsection{Student Smart Homes (SSH)}

Smart home technology is increasingly popular in homes throughout the UK. Student Smart Homes (SSH) is a start-up which specialises in producing hardware and software specifically aimed at student houses. The products are marketed either directly at students or providers of student accommodation. For students to be able to use the products, they must be suitable for use in rented accommodation. In other words, they must not require any permanent modifications to the accommodation. In either case, the products must be suitable for multiple users, who may not have the same level of trust for each other as members of the same family.

Some of their existing products are outlined in the following sections.

\subsubsection{The SSH Hub - First Class}

The SSH Hub - First Class is Student Smart Homes' most recent smart home hub product. The device is USB-powered and connects other SSH products in the student home (via Bluetooth or WiFi) to the SSH Cloud (via WiFi). It runs software which detect SSH products in range, communicates with them, and propagates information between the SSH Cloud and those devices.

\subsubsection{The SSH Cloud}

The SSH Cloud encompasses all of Student Smart Homes' online services. It includes both a web-based interface that users can access to manage their accounts and remote-control their devices, as well as services that exchange information with the SSH Hubs.

\subsubsection{The SSH Camera}

The SSH Camera is a smart camera which can be positioned almost anywhere thanks to versatile mounting options, including a roll of sticky tape that comes included for free in the box. The camera can be used for multiple different scenarios thanks to its AI features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item By pointing the SSH camera at the front door, it can detect who enters and leaves the student house. The SSH Console (sold separately) will then show a beautiful overview of who is or has been in the house and when.
    \item By pointing the SSH camera at the sink, it can detect who just dumps their dirty dishes in it and never washes up. The SSH Cloud (subscription required) will then automatically send notifications to the SSH App to remind those house mates to clean up.
\end{itemize}
