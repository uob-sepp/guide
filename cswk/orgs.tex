\section{Your organisation}
\label{sec:organisations}

To frame the tasks you will be carrying out for this module's assessments, you will choose one organisation from the following options. You will \emph{pretend} to work for this organisation and the assessments represent tasks that you are carrying out for that organisation. The choice is entirely yours, but you will stick with the same organisation \emph{for all three assessments}. In particular, note that the second coursework is carried out as a group. While you will be able to choose your own group, you can only team up with others \emph{in the same organisation}. You may wish to take this into consideration when choosing an organisation, as well as your own personal interests.

The descriptions of the companies and their products are merely supposed to give you an idea of what sort of companies they are, what sort of products they make, and how they broadly work. For your coursework, you are free to make further assumptions about other products not described here, features not described here that you rely on but exceed the scope of your work, or implementation aspects not mentioned here. You should however document any such assumptions you make.
